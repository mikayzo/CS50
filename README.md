# Problem Sets for Harvard's 'CS50 Introduction to Computer Science'

## Status:
    Will update whenever I finish either a single task or the whole problem set

## Usage:
    
    * In order to compile these C source codes you can use `make50`: 
    
    ./make50 <filename.c>
    
    * You can move `make50` to `/usr/local/bin/make50` in order to use it as: 
    
    make50 <filename.c>
